# PRG1 Assignment Test Cases
Test cases for the PRG1 assignment due August 9 2021.

This repository contains testcases to test out your code before submitting your work to your lecturer.
These test cases also help to detect undefined behaviour and will speed up your development rate.

Note: The test cases have been designed as per the behaviour defined in the screenshots of the assignment document.
There is no guarantee that the test cases for the advanced features are accurate. The user should adjust the test 
cases to fit their code's behaviour in such a case.

# Requirements
Python, duh

Your program file should read from STDIN (python already handles that)

# Installation
No installation is required. However it is advisable to clone the repository into your working directory to speed up
testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Egg-Fish/PRG1-Testcases.git
cd PRG1-Testcases
```

# Usage

For programs that do not implement the additional features, the test cases you should be using is under the `basic` folder.

1. Open the test case file that you want to run
2. Press Ctrl-A to select everything
3. Press Ctrl-C to copy the whole test case
4. Run your program in python
5. If you are using the IDLE Shell, press Ctrl-V to paste the testcase into the shell. Press enter to run the code.
6. If you are using a terminal or PyCharm, press Ctrl-V on the terminal to run the code.
